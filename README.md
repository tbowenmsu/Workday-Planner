# Workday-Planner-HW-05

I created this workday planner as the homework-05 for the MSU coding bootcamp.

This project utilizes HTML, JavaScript, jQ and a little CSS to create a daily schedule that shows the current date. 

It has a working-day hourly schedule that shows current time in red, past time in grey, and future time in green. The text boxes allow for input text and a save icon to save it locally.
